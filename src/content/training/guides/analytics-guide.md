# Analytics & Reports

Orben's analytics help you answer the questions that actually matter: What's making me money? What's wasting my time? Where should I focus?

## The Analytics page

Go to **Analytics** in the sidebar. You'll see:

- **Revenue trend** — how much you've made over time
- **Platform breakdown** — which marketplace drives the most sales
- **Category performance** — which item types sell best
- **Average profit per sale** — are you improving over time?

Use the date range picker to filter by any time period.

## Reports

**Reports** (in the sidebar under Analytics) generates exportable summaries including:

- Total revenue, cost, profit
- Number of items sold
- Platform summary (per-marketplace breakdown)
- Category summary
- Month-by-month comparison

You can export to CSV or PDF.

## Profit Calendar

The **Profit Calendar** shows a heatmap of your daily earnings. This helps you spot patterns — maybe you sell more on weekends, or certain months are stronger.

## Platform Performance

**Platform Performance** shows a direct comparison between your marketplaces:

- Sales volume per platform
- Average sale price
- Total revenue
- Sell-through rate (if tracked)

Use this to decide where to focus your listing effort.

## Using analytics to make decisions

**Find your best category.** Sort by average profit. If sneakers average $25 profit and electronics average $8, shift sourcing toward sneakers.

**Identify stale inventory.** Check items listed 60+ days with no sale — reprice them or move them to a different platform.

**Track your sell-through rate.** Are you selling what you're buying? If you import 100 items and only 30 sell in 90 days, your sourcing strategy needs adjustment.

**Spot seasonal trends.** Use the Profit Calendar to see if certain months are consistently stronger, then plan your sourcing accordingly.
