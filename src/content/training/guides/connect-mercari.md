# Connect Mercari

Connecting Mercari lets Orben import your active listings, sync sold items, and crosslist new inventory to Mercari with one click.

## Before you start

- You need an active Mercari seller account
- Make sure you're logged into Mercari in another browser tab (this helps the connection process go faster)

## How to connect

1. Go to **Settings** in the left sidebar
2. Scroll to **Marketplace Connections**
3. Click **Connect** next to Mercari
4. A browser window will open — log in to your Mercari account if prompted
5. Approve the connection when asked

Orben uses your session to communicate with Mercari. Your credentials are never stored.

## After connecting

Once connected, you'll see Mercari listed as **Active** in your connections. You can then:

- Run an import from **Import → Run Mercari Import**
- See Mercari listings in your Inventory
- Crosslist items to Mercari from the Crosslist composer

## Troubleshooting

**"Connection failed" error**
- Make sure you're logged into Mercari in a browser first, then retry
- Try refreshing the page and reconnecting

**Mercari shows as connected but import returns 0 items**
- Your Mercari account may have no active listings
- Check that your Mercari account is in good standing
