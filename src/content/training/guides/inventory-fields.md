# Inventory Fields Explained

Here's every field in Orben's inventory system and what it's used for.

## Core fields

### Title
The listing title. Appears on every marketplace. Include brand, model, size, color, and relevant keywords. Max 80 characters recommended.

### Description
The full item description. Supports line breaks. Mention condition, measurements, included accessories, and any flaws. Be honest — it reduces returns.

### Price
Your asking price. This is what buyers see. You can set different prices per marketplace during crosslisting.

### Purchase Price
What you paid for the item. Used for profit calculations. If you got it for free, put $0.

### Condition
- **New with tags** — still has original retail tags
- **Like New** — no visible wear, may be without tags
- **Good** — minor signs of use, fully functional
- **Fair** — visible wear, but still functional
- **For parts** — not fully functional

### Category
Used for organization and marketplace mapping. Choose the most specific category that fits.

## Details fields

### Brand
The item's brand or manufacturer. Leave blank if unbranded.

### Size
Clothing/shoe size. Format varies by category (S/M/L, numeric, EU sizing, etc.).

### Color
Primary color(s). Used for filtering and some marketplace search fields.

### SKU
Your internal tracking code. Optional. Useful if you run a higher-volume operation.

## Logistics fields

### Weight
Item weight including packaging. Used for shipping label calculations.

### Dimensions
Length × Width × Height of the packaged item. Used for dimensional weight calculations.

### Zip Code
Your ship-from zip code. Used for shipping rate estimates and some platform location fields.

## Business fields

### Purchase Date
When you acquired the item. Used for aging reports (how long something has been in inventory).

### Notes
Internal notes visible only to you. Good for tracking source (thrift store name, bin number, etc.).

### Photos
Up to 12 photos. First photo is the hero image shown in search results. Always include:
1. Front view
2. Back view
3. Brand tag / label
4. Any flaws (even if minor)
