# Crosslist Workflow

Crosslisting is listing the same item on multiple marketplaces at once. More exposure = faster sales. Orben makes it a 3-step workflow instead of logging into each platform separately.

## Why crosslist?

- Items often sit on one platform while selling instantly on another
- Different buyer pools exist on eBay vs Mercari vs Facebook
- More listings = more chances to be found

## The crosslist flow

### Step 1 — Pick items

Go to **Crosslist** in the sidebar. You'll see your inventory items that aren't yet listed on all your connected marketplaces.

Select the items you want to crosslist (you can do multiple at once).

### Step 2 — Review and customize

For each item, Orben pre-fills the listing details from your inventory record. You can:
- Adjust the price per platform (price differently on different sites)
- Edit the description
- Choose which platforms to post to

### Step 3 — Post

Click **Post to Selected Platforms**. Orben submits the listing to each marketplace and marks the item as listed.

## Pro tips

**Different prices per platform.** Mercari buyers expect lower prices than eBay. Test different prices on different platforms and see what moves faster.

**Keep titles clean.** Some platforms (especially Poshmark) don't want you to include price in the title. Orben handles platform-specific rules automatically.

**Don't list on too many places at once without managing it.** If you sell something manually and forget to delist everywhere else, you'll get double-sold. Orben tracks which platforms each item is listed on to help you manage this.

## Managing active crosslistings

In your Inventory, each item shows badges for which platforms it's currently listed on. When a sale syncs, Orben automatically marks the item as sold and can delist it from other platforms (if that option is enabled in Settings).
