# Profit Tracking

Orben calculates net profit on every sale automatically. Here's exactly how it works and how to make sure your numbers are right.

## The profit formula

```
Net Profit = Sale Price − Purchase Price − Marketplace Fee − Shipping Cost − Custom Fees
```

### Sale Price
The amount the buyer paid (before any deductions).

### Purchase Price
What you paid to acquire the item. Set this on the inventory item. **If this is missing, Orben can't calculate profit.** Always fill this in, even if it's $0.

### Marketplace Fee
Each platform charges a selling fee (usually 10–15% of sale price). Orben calculates these automatically using current fee schedules:

| Platform | Fee |
|----------|-----|
| eBay | ~12.9% + $0.30 |
| Mercari | 10% |
| Facebook | 5% or flat $0.40 |
| Poshmark | 20% (for items over $15) |

> Fees can change. Always verify with the platform's official fee calculator for high-value items.

### Shipping Cost
If you pay for shipping, Orben subtracts this from profit. Shipping cost is pulled from sale records when available.

### Custom Fees
You can add recurring business expenses (storage, supplies, subscription fees) that get distributed across sales. Set these in **Settings → Custom Fees**.

## Making your numbers accurate

**1. Always set purchase price.** Even if you sourced from a free pile, mark it $0. Items with no purchase price show "$?" profit.

**2. Set custom fees.** If you spend $50/month on shipping supplies, add that as a recurring fee so it's reflected in your per-sale profit.

**3. Review synced sales.** When a sale syncs automatically, check that the shipping cost and fee imported correctly.

**4. Use the Profit Calendar.** The calendar view shows you daily profit at a glance. Red days = you spent more than you made. Good for spotting outliers quickly.

## Tax note

Orben shows gross profit (before income tax). For tax purposes, your accountable profit may be different. Consult a tax professional for your specific situation.

Orben does generate a Tax Summary report (under Reports) with total sales, COGS, and gross profit — which is useful for providing data to your accountant.
