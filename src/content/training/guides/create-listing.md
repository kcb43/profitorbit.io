# Create a Listing

You can create listings from scratch inside Orben, or import existing ones from your marketplaces. Creating from scratch is best when you have new inventory to list.

## Add an inventory item

1. Click **Add Inventory Item** in the sidebar (or the + button on the Inventory page)
2. Fill in the item details:
   - **Title** — be descriptive and keyword-rich
   - **Description** — mention condition, brand, measurements
   - **Price** — your asking price
   - **Purchase price** — what you paid (used for profit calculations)
   - **Condition** — New, Like New, Good, Fair, etc.
   - **Photos** — upload up to 12 photos

3. Click **Save** to add it to inventory

## Push to a marketplace

Once in inventory, you can publish it to any connected marketplace:

1. Open the item from your Inventory list
2. Click **Crosslist** or **Publish**
3. Choose the marketplace(s) — eBay, Mercari, Facebook, etc.
4. Review the auto-filled fields and adjust as needed
5. Click **Post Listing**

## Tips for great listings

**Photos matter most.** Clean background, good lighting, show every angle. Buyers decide in 2 seconds based on the photo.

**Keywords in the title.** Include brand, model, size, color. These words are how buyers find you.

**Price to sell.** Check what similar items sold for (not just what they're listed for). Use the **Product Search** tool to benchmark prices.

**Accurate condition.** Buyers trust sellers who describe condition honestly. It reduces returns and bad feedback.

## After publishing

Your item will appear in your Inventory with a marketplace badge showing where it's listed. When it sells, Orben can sync the sale automatically (if marketplace sync is enabled).
