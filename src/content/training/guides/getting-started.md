# Getting Started with Orben

Welcome to Orben — your all-in-one reselling command center. This guide walks you through everything you need to do on day one to get your operation running.

## What Orben does

Orben connects to your selling marketplaces (eBay, Mercari, Facebook Marketplace, Poshmark), imports your listings and sales, and gives you a single dashboard to track profit, crosslist items, and spot deals.

## Step 1 — Connect a marketplace

The first thing you should do is connect at least one marketplace so Orben can import your data.

Head to **Settings → Marketplace Connections** and click **Connect** next to any platform you sell on.

> Start with whichever marketplace has the most of your active listings.

## Step 2 — Import your inventory

Once connected, trigger an import from **Import → Run Import**. Orben will scan your marketplace listings and pull them into your inventory.

This usually takes 1–3 minutes depending on how many items you have.

## Step 3 — Review your inventory

Go to **Inventory** to see everything that was imported. You can edit item details, add purchase prices (for profit tracking), and tag items for better organization.

## Step 4 — Record a sale

When something sells, go to **Add Sale** and log the transaction. Orben calculates your net profit automatically after fees and shipping.

Or connect your marketplace and Orben will sync sales automatically as they happen.

## Step 5 — Explore the dashboard

Your dashboard shows:
- Today's profit and sales count
- Active listings per platform
- Deal feed from Orben Intelligence
- Quick actions for common tasks

## What's next?

Once you're set up, explore these features:
- **Crosslist** — list one item on multiple marketplaces in seconds
- **Analytics** — see which platforms and categories are most profitable
- **Deal Feed** — find sourcing deals from Amazon, Walmart, and more
- **Playbooks** — follow guided workflows for common reselling tasks
